\textbf{Question 4:} NOT SOLVED YET.

\textbf{Question 5:} Let $\mathcal{H}$ be any hypothesis set, where $h:\mathcal{X}\to \{-1,1\}$ for all $h\in \mathcal{H}$. Theorem 2.4 in Abu-Mostafa 2015 states that if $m_\mathcal{H}(d) < 2^d$ for some $d \in \mathbb{N}$, then for all $N\in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{align}
m_\mathcal{H}(N) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \binom{N}{i}
\end{align}
From this and question 4, it directly follows that if $m_\mathcal{H}(k) < 2^d$ for some $d \in \mathbb{N}$, then for all $N\in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{align}
m_\mathcal{H}(N) \leq N^{d-1} + 1
\end{align}

\textbf{Question 6:} Let $\mathcal{H}$ be any hypothesis set, where $h:\mathcal{X}\to \{-1,1\}$ for all $h\in \mathcal{H}$, and assume that there exists some $d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m_\mathcal{H}(d) < 2^d$. From question 1, we know that for all $N\in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{align}
m_\mathcal{H}(N) \leq 2^N
\end{align}
From question 6, we know that for all $N\in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{align}
m_\mathcal{H}(N) \leq N^{d-1} + 1
\end{align}
Therefore, we get that for all $N\in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{align}
m_\mathcal{H}(N) \leq \min (N^{d-1} + 1, 2^N)
\end{align}
Let $\mathcal{N}_\mathcal{H}$ be defined as in question 2, and assume that $N \in \mathcal{N}_\mathcal{H}$. By definition of $\mathcal{N}_\mathcal{H}$ we now have that
\begin{align}
m_\mathcal{H}(N)=2^N 
\end{align}
From combining line (XXXX) and (XXXX), we now get that
\begin{align}
2^N \leq N^{d-1} + 1
\end{align}
Define 
\begin{align}
A_d = \{N \ |\  2^N \leq N^{d-1} + 1\}
\end{align}
Line (XXXX - XXXX) proofs that
\begin{align}
\mathcal{N}_\mathcal{H}\subset A_d
\end{align}
which implies
\begin{align}
d_{VC}(\mathcal{H}) = \max \mathcal{N}_\mathcal{H} \leq \max A_d
\end{align}
If the numerical value of $A_d$ is of any interest, it can be found numerically for any $d$. $A_d$ is namely finite for any $d\in \mathbb{N}$, because the lefthand inequality defining $A_d$ is exponential, whereas the right hand side is polynomial.


\textbf{Question 7:} We see from the fact that the quantity
\begin{align}
\binom{N}{d-1}
\end{align}
must be meaningful in order for line (XXXX) in question 5 to be meaningful that $d-1\leq N$. If this is not the case and $d-1>N$, we also have that
\begin{align}
2^N \leq N^{d-1} + 1
\end{align}
is true for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$, which implies that
\begin{align}
A_d = \mathbb{N}
\end{align}
which implies that the bound on line (XXXX) turns into
\begin{align}
d_{VC}(\mathcal{H}) \leq \infty
\end{align}
which is not a very useful bound.
