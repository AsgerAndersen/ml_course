\textbf{Question 1:} In this case, our hypothesis space $\mathcal{H} = \{h_1,...,h_M \}$ is finite with $|\mathcal{H}| = M$, which means that we can use \textbf{Theorem 3.2} to conclude that with probability $1 - \delta$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}$
\begin{align}
L(\hat{h}^*) \leq \hat{L}(\hat{h}^*, S_{val}) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{M}{\delta}}{2n}}
\end{align}
where $n=|S_{val}|$.

\textbf{Question 2:} Let $S_{val}^*$ be the validation set om which we are testing the hypothesis $\hat{h}^*$ that we end up choosing. In the setup proposed by our fellow student, we are only testing a single hypothesis, namely $\hat{h}^*$, on $S_{val}^*$, and $|S_{val^*}|=\frac{n}{M}$. Therefore, we can use \textbf{Theorem 3.1} to conclude that with probability $1 - \delta$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}$
\begin{align}
L(\hat{h}^*) \leq \hat{L}(\hat{h}^*, S_{val}) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{2\frac{n}{M}}} = \hat{L}(\hat{h}^*, S_{val}) + \sqrt{\frac{ M \ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{2n}}
\end{align}
Our fellow student has therefore made a bad proposal, since bound is now growing linearly with $M$ instead of logarithmically.

\textbf{Question 3:} Again we only test a single hypothesis, namely $\hat{h}^*$, on $S_{val}^2$. This time we have that $|S_{val}^2|=\frac{n}{2}$. Therefore, we can use \textbf{Theorem 3.1} to conclude that with probability $1 - \delta$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}$
\begin{align}
L(\hat{h}^*) \leq \hat{L}(\hat{h}^*, S_{val}) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{2\frac{n}{2}}} = \hat{L}(\hat{h}^*, S_{val}) + \sqrt{\frac{ \ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{n}}
\end{align}

Assume that my fellow student followed this procedure, and I followed the procedure in question 1. Let $\hat{h}^*$ be the hypothesis that I end up choosing, and let $\tilde{h}^*$ be the hypothesis my fellow student chooses. Where I am using the full $S_{val}$ to choose $\hat{h}^*$, my fellow student is only using $S^1_{val}$ to choose $\tilde{h}^*$. Therefore, we cannot not be sure that $\hat{h}^* = \tilde{h}^*$. Apart from not knowing whether we choose the same hypothesis, we also do not test our chosen hypothesis on the same set. Where I am using $S_{val}$, my fellow student is using $S_{val}^2$. All in all, it is therefore not very easy to tell know how close my empirical error $\hat{L}(\hat{h}^*,S_{val})$ is to the empirical error $\hat{L}(\tilde{h}^*,S_{val}^2)$ of my fellow student. However, we can say that I have a higher probability of choosing the hypothesis $h_i$ in $\mathcal{H}$ with the lowest expected loss $L(h_i)$, since I am using a bigger validation set to inform my decision.

If we assume that $\hat{L}(\hat{h}^*,S_{val}) = \hat{L}(\tilde{h}^*,S_{val}^2)$, then we know that my bound is tighter than my fellow student's, if and only if
\begin{align}
\sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{M}{\delta}}{2n}} < \sqrt{\frac{ \ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{n}} 
\end{align}
This is equivalent to
\begin{align}
\ln \frac{M}{\delta} < 2 \ln \frac{1}{\delta}
\end{align}
which is equivalent to
\begin{align}
\frac{M}{\delta} < \left( \frac{1}{\delta} \right)^2
\end{align}
which is equivalent to
\begin{align}
M \delta < 1
\end{align}
This means that under the assumption that $\hat{L}(\hat{h}^*,S_{val}) = \hat{L}(\tilde{h}^*,S_{val}^2)$, then if we for instance wanted a certainty $1-\delta = 0.95$, then my procedure would have a tighter bound, if and only if $M < 20$. 

As I had already said, then even if we had a big $M$, my fellow student would still be less certain than me of picking the best hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$, which is a drawback of his method.

\textbf{Question 4:} As I have already explained in question 3, then choosing a large $\alpha$ - and thereby a large validation set $S_{val}^1$ - means having a better chance of choosing the hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$, which actually has the lowest expected loss, as $\hat{h}^*$. This also means that we should expect a lower empirical loss $L(\hat{h}^*,S_{val}^2)$ on the test set $S_{val}^2$ than if we had used a smaller validation set to choose $\hat{h}^*$. However, a large $\alpha$ also means a small test set. Therefore, we also get more uncertain how well the empirical loss $L(\hat{h}^*,S_{val}^2)$ on the test set reflects the true expected loss $L(\hat{h}^*)$. This can be seen by the fact that the term
\begin{align}
\sqrt{\frac{ \ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{2(1-\alpha)n}}
\end{align}
in our bound
\begin{align}
L(\hat{h}^*) \leq = \hat{L}(\hat{h}^*, S_{val}^2) + \sqrt{\frac{ \ln \frac{1}{\delta}}{2(1-\alpha)n}}
\end{align}
grows when $\alpha$ becomes larger. All in all, it therefore not clear whether a larger $\alpha$ will make us choose $\hat{h}^*$, such that the resulting bound on $L(\hat{h}^*)$ becomes larger or smaller. In general, the larger $M$ becomes, the larger I would also choose $\alpha$, since a large hypothesis space also means a large probability of accidentally choosing a bad hypothesis as $\hat{h}^*$, if the validation set is too small.
